# Claim Rules (CRL-0)

**License stage:** CRL-0 / observer-only / non-authoritative.
These rules govern what this channel will and will not publish.
They are **distinct from the Five Axioms**, which are structural statements presented separately.

## Rules

1. **No operational claims.**
   No methods, thresholds, tuning rules, playbooks, calibration procedures, scoring mechanics, enforcement mechanisms, or recipes of application.

2. **No authority claims.**
   No certification of systems, people, or compliance. No approvals. No "pass/fail."

3. **No predictive claims.**
   No promises of outcomes, performance, safety, alignment, controllability, or future behavior.

4. **No counterfeit coverage.**
   If bounded observability cannot be stated, the claim is refused. Admitted absence is permitted; implied coverage is prohibited.

5. **Receipts before expansion.**
   Expansion of scope is treated as a governance event. Expansion without receipts is treated as narrative drift.

6. **Refusal is not negotiable.**
   If a boundary is declared, refusal must remain available without exception.

7. **Continuation is conditional.**
   Continuation is allowed only within declared bounds and with an explicit stop condition.
