# Constraint Spine

Versioned, auditable canon for a boundary-first program.

This repository is the **public source of truth** for scope, exclusions,
reading order, controlled vocabulary, and governance decisions.

## Start here

1. [Reading Order](docs/reading-order.md) — Paper VI first
2. [Papers Index](docs/papers.md) — Zenodo records with DOIs
3. [Glossary](docs/glossary.md) — 20 controlled terms
4. [License Posture: CRL-0](docs/licenses/CRL-0.md) / [OEL-1](docs/licenses/OEL-1.md)
5. [FAQ](docs/faq.md) — boundary-first answers
6. [Spine Index](docs/index.md) — full document map

## What this is not

- Not a methods repository
- Not an implementation guide
- Not an optimizer, controller, or predictor

## Change policy

Every edit to this repository is a governance event:
reviewed, diffable, and version-tagged.

See [ADR-0008](registry/DECISIONS/ADR-0008.md) for the rationale.

## License

Observer-only. Non-authoritative. No directives.
