# DEF_RECORD — Record

## Definition

A bounded trace attached to a claim, preserving scope and absences without persuasion.

A record is not an argument. It is the irreducible residue of a governed observation: what was bounded, what was observed, and what was absent.

## Non-equivalences

- Record is not narrative (narrative interprets; record preserves).
- Record is not evidence (evidence argues; record traces).
- Record is not log (log accumulates; record is scoped and bounded).
- Record is not proof (proof concludes; record constrains).

## Exclusions

- No procedure for record creation is defined here.
- No quality metric for records is stated.
- No completeness requirement is implied.
- No enforcement semantics attach to records.

## Notes

Record is primitive in the governance sense: governance begins with trace, not with explanation. A receipt is a record that has been attached to a specific claim under declared bounds.
