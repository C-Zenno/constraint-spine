# CG-FN-1 — Continuation Regimes and Closure

**Status:** RESERVED — slot claimed, section structure locked.

## Scope

This Foundation Note introduces vocabulary for:
1. Continuation regimes (regions where continuation is permitted)
2. Closure under admissible iteration
3. Grounding / anchoring (receiptable constraints)
4. Disallowed conflations (what recursion is *not*)
5. Custody / continuity constraint (identity precondition)

---

## 1. Continuation Regime

*(Content pending)*

A continuation regime is a declared region of behavior within which continuation is permitted. Regimes are characterized by what remains coherent under admissible evolution, not by what is computed or optimized.

---

## 2. Closure Under Admissible Iteration

*(Content pending)*

Closure is the property that repeated application of admissible evolution does not exit the declared regime. Closure is a structural constraint, not a verification procedure.

---

## 3. Grounding / Anchoring

*(Content pending)*

Grounding refers to the admissible anchors that make continuation receiptable. Anchors are declared constraints, not discovered facts.

---

## 4. Disallowed Conflations

The following conflations are **refused** by this program:

- **Recursion ≠ substrate.** Iteration under closure is not a claim about physical or computational substrate.
- **Recursion ≠ retrieval / memory.** Closure does not imply storage, recall, or memory mechanisms.
- **Recursion ≠ semantics / meaning inference.** Continuation is structural; it does not assert or derive meaning.
- **Recursion ≠ verification / truth upgrade.** Closure does not validate, prove, or elevate claims to truth status.
- **"Gravity" / "attractor" is descriptive stability language, not mechanism.** These terms describe observed persistence patterns; they do not assert underlying forces or dynamics.

---

## 5. Custody / Continuity Constraint

**Identity claims require custody and receiptable continuity.**

If a substrate owner can silently reset, trim, or merge state without receipt, continuation is not claimable. Identity is not asserted over substrates where continuity cannot be audited.

This is a precondition for identity claims, not an enforcement mechanism.

---

## Prohibitions (locked)

1. **No procedures, thresholds, or authority upgrades.** This note defines vocabulary and interpretive boundaries only.
2. **Recursion ≠ ontology / verification / semantics.** Iteration and closure are structural concepts, not ontological claims or verification procedures.
3. **No operational measurability.** The anchor ladder describes categorical distinctions, not scoring rules or numeric thresholds.

## Dependencies

- CG-FN-0 (Claimability / admissible time / identity + snapshot refusal) — required foundation

## Placeholder Notice

This file reserves the CG-FN-1 identifier. Section structure is locked. Full content for sections 1-3 will be added when the note is drafted and reviewed. Sections 4-5 (Disallowed Conflations, Custody/Continuity) are substantively complete.
