# FAQ (Boundary-First)

## Is this an optimization framework?

No. Optimization is explicitly out of scope. This program preserves refusal-first boundaries and avoids turning diagnostics into directives.

## Does this tell you what to do?

No. Outputs (where present) are non-authoritative and non-directive. The posture forbids prescriptions.

## Does this include triggers or thresholds?

No. Threshold-driven control surfaces are excluded from public doctrine. Markers are not triggers.

## Is there an algorithm I can implement from this repo?

No. This repo is a declarative spine: scope, exclusions, reading order, and controlled vocabulary. Operationalization is out of scope.

## Why be so strict?

Because the common failure mode is predictable: explanatory surfaces drift into "how-to," which becomes instrumentation, then control. The boundary prevents that drift.

## Where are the papers?

See `docs/papers.md` for the index and record links.

## What should I read first?

Start with Paper VI (boundary paper). Then read the license posture pages and glossary.
