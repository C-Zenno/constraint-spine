# Glossary (Controlled Vocabulary)

**Legend (IP status markers):**
- **[PUBLIC]** Safe to define categorically.
- **[CONTROLLED]** Name may be public; definition must stay non-operational.
- **[INTERNAL]** Term may be referenced but not defined here.

**Rule:** Definitions describe **what a term *means*** at a categorical level, not **how to compute, detect, calibrate, or act**.

## Terms

1) **Admissibility** — **[PUBLIC]**
A condition that restricts what can be asserted or continued under finite resolution. It is a boundary concept, not a metric and not an instruction.

2) **Observer-only** — **[PUBLIC]**
A posture in which outputs do not prescribe actions, optimize outcomes, or escalate authority. Outputs may be descriptive or structural, but not directive.

3) **Non-authoritative** — **[PUBLIC]**
A constraint on interpretation: outputs are not claims of truth, correctness, or ground reality—only bounded descriptions under stated limits.

4) **Finite resolution** — **[PUBLIC]**
A statement that observation and representation occur with limited granularity (time, bandwidth, sampling, precision). This limits what can be concluded.

5) **Boundary** — **[PUBLIC]**
A declared exclusion region: what the system refuses to infer, output, or operationalize.

6) **Continuation** — **[PUBLIC]**
The decision to proceed within a regime without escalating scope. Continuation is not guaranteed; refusal is permitted.

7) **Refusal** — **[PUBLIC]**
A permitted outcome where the system declines to produce an output or declines to extend claims beyond allowed scope.

8) **Regime** — **[PUBLIC]**
A region of behavior or stability defined by what remains coherent under finite resolution, without specifying the underlying mechanism.

9) **Coherence** — **[CONTROLLED]**
A structural property describing how strongly a system holds together under perturbation and limited observation. No operational measure is defined here.

10) **Deviation** — **[CONTROLLED]**
A categorical notion of drift relative to a reference structure. No computation rules are defined here.

11) **Curvature (stability basin)** — **[CONTROLLED]**
A geometric metaphor for local robustness/fragility. This surface does not provide formulas or estimation procedures.

12) **Return-time** — **[CONTROLLED]**
A qualitative notion of recovery latency after perturbation. No detector or estimator is defined here.

13) **Marker** — **[CONTROLLED]**
A non-directive indicator that something is changing. Markers are not triggers and must not be mapped into actions.

14) **Threshold** — **[PUBLIC — PROHIBITED AS METHOD]**
A numeric trigger boundary. This program explicitly avoids threshold-driven control surfaces in public doctrine.

15) **Instrumentation** — **[PUBLIC]**
Any process that turns observations into actionable signals. Instrumentation is excluded from declarative surfaces.

16) **Optimization** — **[PUBLIC]**
A process that selects actions to maximize an objective. Optimization is excluded from observer-only posture.

17) **Control** — **[PUBLIC]**
Any closed-loop action selection that modifies a system to achieve a target. Control is excluded from observer-only posture.

18) **Operationalization** — **[PUBLIC]**
The act of turning a concept into a procedure, implementation, or recipe. Operationalization is out of scope here.

19) **Jurisdiction** — **[PUBLIC]**
The declared boundary of what a document or system claims authority over (and what it refuses).

20) **Governance event** — **[PUBLIC]**
Any change that could expand scope, weaken exclusions, or enable operational inference. Governance events require review and explicit rationale.
