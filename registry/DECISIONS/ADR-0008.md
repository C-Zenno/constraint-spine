# ADR-0008 — Canon lives in versioned docs (not mutable wiki pages)

## Context

We need a public-facing "wiki" surface that:
- is auditable and diffable
- resists silent drift
- preserves hard boundaries (no methods)
- supports citation by version/tag

Mutable CMS / wiki pages encourage silent mutation, explainability creep, and gradual operational leakage.

## Decision

The canonical public "wiki" will be:
- **Markdown docs in a versioned repository** (docs spine)
- updated only via reviewed changes (PRs / commits / tags)
- rendered by the website as a presentation layer (brochure/view), not as the source of truth

## Consequences

### Positive
- Every change is reviewable (diffs)
- Stable citations (commit/tag)
- Clear governance: edits are explicit events
- Reduced risk of method leakage via "helpful explanations"

### Negative / trade-offs
- Requires minimal process discipline for edits
- Website cannot be the source of truth
- Some convenience features of wikis are intentionally sacrificed

## Source of truth

Public canon source-of-truth lives in the public GitHub repository. A private staging environment is used for drafting; publication to the public repo is gated by an explicit release process.

## Notes

This ADR is jurisdictional. It does not define methods, implementations, or product behavior.
