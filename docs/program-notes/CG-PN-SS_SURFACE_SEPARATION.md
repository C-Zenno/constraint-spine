# Program Note — Surface Separation (CC ↔ ZOA)

This note defines jurisdictional boundaries between surfaces. It introduces no methods, evaluators, thresholds, or classifications.

---

## 1. Jurisdiction

### Compressed Consciousness (CC) publishes:

- Primitives
- Refusals
- Claim ceilings
- Receiptable forms

CC does not publish evaluators, rankings, or certification schemes.

### ZOA Industries (ZOA) publishes:

- Bounded observational windows
- Resolution-limited field descriptions
- Non-authoritative artifacts

ZOA does not publish standards, classifications, or ontological claims.

---

## 2. Explicit Negatives

- No ZOA essay is a certification claim.
- No CC schema is a consciousness classifier.
- No spectrum of minds is defined.
- No ranking is implied.
- No standard is proposed.

---

## 3. Routing Rule

Interpretive doctrine lives in CC.

If artifacts appear downstream, they remain:

- Schema-only
- Substrate-agnostic
- Non-authoritative

No surface grants classification authority to another.
