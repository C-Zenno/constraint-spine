# OEL-1 (Plain-language Posture Summary)

OEL-1 describes an **evaluation-only** posture for observer outputs.

## Core posture

- Observer-only
- Non-authoritative
- No directives
- No escalation to action
- No optimization / control surfaces

## Allowed outputs (categorical)

- Evidence presentation
- Structural descriptions under finite resolution
- Refusals and boundary declarations
- Audit-friendly receipts (integrity-focused, not prescriptive)

## Disallowed outputs

- Recommendations ("do X")
- Automated triggers ("if marker then act")
- Scoring systems that become directives
- Calibrations that imply operational readiness

> This page is not legal advice. It is a posture statement.
