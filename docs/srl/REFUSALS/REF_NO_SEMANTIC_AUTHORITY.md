# REF_NO_SEMANTIC_AUTHORITY — No Semantic Authority

## Prohibition statement

This program refuses to claim semantic authority: no outputs are warrants for action, correctness, ground truth, compliance, certification, or endorsement. Non-authoritative posture means outputs are bounded descriptions under stated limits.

## Applies to

- All CRL-0 surfaces
- All derivative projections including SRL
- All SRL units: index entries, definitions, invariants, and refusals are non-authoritative

## Non-claims

- This refusal does not claim that authority is illegitimate in all contexts.
- This refusal does not claim that the program's concepts are unimportant.
- This refusal states only that CRL-0 outputs do not carry action-authorizing, truth-warranting, or compliance-certifying force.
