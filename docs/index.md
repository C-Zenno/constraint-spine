# Canonical Spine (Public)

This repository is a **versioned, auditable canon** for a boundary-first program: what is in scope, what is excluded, and how to read the work **without drifting into method surfaces**.

This is not a product, not a control system, and not an operational playbook.

## Start here

1) **READING_ORDER** — the single rule for how to enter the work.
2) **LICENSE POSTURE** — what is permitted and what is forbidden.
3) **GLOSSARY** — controlled vocabulary (definitions without methods).
4) **CLAIM RULES** — CRL-0 speech constraints governing what this channel will and will not publish.
5) **SIGNATURE MAP** — the recurring legibility map (Claim → Receipt → Refusal → Continuation).
6) **HIERARCHY** — claim-discipline ordering of primitives and dependent terms (vocabulary, not derivation).
7) **SPINE MAP** — full structural map with document relationships and dependency edges.
8) **PAPERS** — paper index linking to records (not rehosting instructions).
9) **FOUNDATION NOTES** — jurisdictional clarifications (vocabulary + refusals only).

## What this repo is

- A **doctrine ledger**: scope, exclusions, and consistent terms.
- A **stable reading order**: to prevent interpretive drift.
- A **diffable public spine**: changes are visible and reviewable.

## What this repo is not

- Not a methods repository.
- Not an implementation guide.
- Not an optimizer, controller, or predictor.
- Not an evaluation harness that escalates to action.

## Foundation Notes

Jurisdictional clarifications that define vocabulary and interpretive boundaries. No procedures, thresholds, or authority upgrades.

## Change policy

Any modification to the spine is a **governance event**:
- must be reviewed as a boundary change
- must preserve exclusions
- must not introduce "how" surfaces
