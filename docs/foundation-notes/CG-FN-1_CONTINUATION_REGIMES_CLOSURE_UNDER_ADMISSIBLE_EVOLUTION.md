# CG-FN-1 — Continuation Regimes and Closure Under Admissible Evolution

## Scope Notice

This Foundation Note defines vocabulary and refusal boundaries for continuation regimes, closure
under admissible iteration, resolution, and grounding/anchoring as governance primitives.

It introduces **no procedures**, **no thresholds**, **no tuning guidance**, and **no deployment claims**.
It does not define verification methods, scoring systems, or semantic tests.

Compatible with Stage-0 posture: **observer-only, refusal-first, non-authoritative, non-predictive**.

---

## Purpose

1. Define continuation as a claim class carried across admissible evolution.
2. Define recursion as closure under admissible iteration (not ontology).
3. Introduce resolution as a granularity constraint on admissible discrimination.
4. Define grounding/anchoring as receiptable continuity constraints.
5. Specify disallowed conflations (recursion ≠ substrate, semantics, or verification).

---

## 0.5 Non-Claims and Refusals (Locked)

This note does **not**:

- certify truth, correctness, or permanence
- define tests, detectors, evaluators, or enforcement recipes
- import mechanism language as explanation (metaphor is permitted; mechanism is refused)
- grant semantic authority (meaning is not extracted or adjudicated here)
- authorize identity upgrades without bounded continuation + receiptable anchoring

This note defines **admissibility classes** and **refusal boundaries** only.

---

## 1. Continuation Regimes (Locked)

### 1.1 Continuation

A **continuation claim** asserts that a declared distinction remains repeatable across an
observation window under admissible evolution (within declared bounds and view perturbations).

Continuation is not sameness at an instant. It is persistence under bounded evolution.

### 1.2 Continuation Regime

A **continuation regime** is a class of admissible evolution in which some structural
distinctions remain repeatable across bounded perturbations.

Continuation regimes describe the conditions under which identity claims remain admissible.

They do not imply determinism, prediction, or ontological permanence.

---

## 2. Recursion as Closure (Stage-0 Definition)

In this program, **recursion** names closure under admissible iteration.

A system is recursive in the Stage-0 sense if its evolution can be described as repeated
application of an admissible transform within a declared continuation regime.

Recursion is:
- not a substrate,
- not a metaphysical primitive,
- not semantic self-awareness,
- not verification of truth.

It is a structural description of continuation under iteration.

Attractor language (e.g., "basin," "gravity," "pull") is descriptive shorthand for stability
under iteration and carries no mechanistic or physical claim.

---

## 3. Resolution as a Constraint Primitive

### 3.1 Resolution (Stage-0 Definition)

**Resolution** is the granularity at which distinctions remain repeatable under bounded
perturbation without importing semantics.

Increasing resolution does not increase metaphysical certainty.
It refines the admissible claim-space by constraining alternative explanations.

### 3.2 Minimal Claim Principle (Admissible Contraction)

Let:

- **E** = a receiptable evidence record
- **S(E)** = the set of admissible statements under E

As resolution increases (E₀ → E₁ → E₂):

> S(E₂) ⊆ S(E₁) ⊆ S(E₀)

Improved resolution contracts interpretation classes; it does not license ontological leaps.

Resolution refines bounds, not verdicts.

---

## 4. Grounding and Anchoring

### 4.1 Anchors (Receiptable Weight Classes)

Anchors are carriers of receiptable continuity constraints.

They differ only in **provenance hardness** and **spoof-cost**, not in metaphysical truth status.

This note defines anchor classes descriptively only.
It does not define scoring, thresholds, enforcement, or verification procedures.

### 4.2 Grounded Continuation

Continuation claims require admissible anchors.
Unconstrained iteration does not license identity claims.

If custody, provenance, or bounded evolution cannot be maintained, continuation claims are not
admissible.

---

## 5. Exclusions (Full) (Locked)

This program explicitly refuses the following upgrades:

- Recursion ≠ substrate
- Recursion ≠ semantic awareness
- Recursion ≠ verification or truth certification
- Recursion ≠ prediction or determinism
- Attractor language ≠ mechanism
- Resolution ≠ probability, truth-likelihood, or consciousness scaling
- Anchors ≠ "proof" (anchors constrain admissibility; they do not certify ontology)
- Continuation ≠ identity at an instant

Closure authorizes refusal statements only.
It does not authorize claims of correctness, permanence, or phenomenology.

---

## 6. Relationship to CG-FN-0

CG-FN-0 defines:

- claimability,
- admissible time,
- identity vs snapshot prohibition,
- geometry closure as refusal.

This note extends those primitives to continuation regimes, iteration closure, and resolution as
a governance operator on claim-space.

---

## 7. Receipts / Traceability

This note is receiptable as a **text artifact** under version control.

- No external datasets are required.
- No experimental claims are made.
- Traceability is provided by repository history (commit/tag) and the published spine index entry.

If a downstream surface cites "continuation," "recursion," "resolution," or "anchoring," it should
cite this note (CG-FN-1) and CG-FN-0 as the vocabulary anchors.

---

## Governance Guardrails (Stage-0)

- No procedures
- No thresholds
- No scoring
- No mechanism import
- No semantic authority
- No domain anchoring
- No ontology claims
- No identity upgrade without bounded continuation + receiptable anchoring

This note defines admissibility classes and refusal boundaries only.
