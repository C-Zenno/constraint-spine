# REF_NO_OPTIMIZATION — No Optimization, Prediction, or Control

## Prohibition statement

This program refuses to publish optimization routines, predictive claims, or control-loop specifications on any CRL-0 surface. Observer-only posture excludes all action-selecting, outcome-maximizing, and future-promising language.

## Applies to

- All CRL-0 surfaces
- All derivative projections including SRL
- Glossary definitions: optimization (#18) and control (#19) are explicitly excluded

## Non-claims

- This refusal does not claim that optimization, prediction, or control are inherently wrong.
- This refusal does not claim that observer-only posture is the only valid posture.
- This refusal states only that these categories are outside CRL-0 scope and outside observer-only posture.
