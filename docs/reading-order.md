# Reading Order

**Rule:** Start with **Paper VI**.

Paper VI is the boundary paper. Everything else must be read as **inheriting its exclusions**.

## Why this order exists

Without a boundary-first entry point, readers tend to:
- turn vocabulary into a method
- treat observables as instruments
- treat diagnostics as directives
- treat "markers" as triggers

This program is jurisdictional before it is explanatory.

## Minimal reading path

1) Paper VI (Boundary / Scope / Exclusions)
2) Paper VII (Continuity — structural condition, not operational)
3) This repo's LICENSE posture pages (CRL-0, OEL-1)
4) Glossary (controlled vocabulary; no method definitions)
5) Papers index (follow links only; no operational extraction)
6) [SRL Reference Layer](srl/README.md) (optional — machine-indexable structural projections; representation-only)
