# CRL-0 (Plain-language Posture Summary)

CRL-0 is a **boundary posture** for public surfaces.

## What CRL-0 permits

- Declarative doctrine: scope, exclusions, definitions (without methods)
- Reading order and interpretive constraints
- High-level descriptions that do not become procedures

## What CRL-0 forbids

- Operational instructions ("how to do it")
- Detection logic, triggers, thresholds, or tuning rules
- Calibration methods or "recommended parameter values"
- Optimization, control, prescription, or action selection
- Any claim that implies authority to decide outcomes

## Why this exists

CRL-0 prevents a predictable failure mode: turning vocabulary into an executable system.
CRL-0 keeps the public canon stable, auditable, and refusal-first.
