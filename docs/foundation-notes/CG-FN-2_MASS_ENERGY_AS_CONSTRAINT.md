# CG-FN-2 — Constraint Load and Persistence Bounds

**Status:** RESERVED — slot claimed, content pending.

## Scope

This Foundation Note will introduce vocabulary for:
- Constraint load (capacity/burden framing)
- Curvature as a geometric metaphor for local robustness/fragility
- The relationship between load and admissibility

## Prohibitions (locked)

1. **No procedures, thresholds, or authority upgrades.** This note defines vocabulary and interpretive boundaries only.
2. **"Burden/constraint load," not "cost."** The framing is structural, not economic or optimizable.
3. **No operational measurability claims.** Constraint load is a categorical concept; this note does not specify how to measure, estimate, or act on it.

## Dependencies

- CG-FN-0 (Claimability / admissible time / identity + snapshot refusal) — required foundation
- CG-FN-1 (Continuation regimes and closure) — required for regime vocabulary

## Placeholder Notice

This file reserves the CG-FN-2 identifier. Content will be added when the note is drafted and reviewed. The prohibitions above are locked and will carry into the final version.
