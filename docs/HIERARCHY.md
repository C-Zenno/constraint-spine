# Hierarchy (Constraint Physics)

**Posture:** CRL-0 / observer-only / non-authoritative.
This is a **vocabulary ordering** used to discipline claims. It is **not** a derivation, mechanism, model, or causal theory.

## What it is
A field-level ordering of primitives and dependent terms used to keep statements scoped and non-overreaching.

## What it is not
- Not a derivation
- Not a mechanism
- Not a model
- Not a causal explanation of physics
- Not a proof

## The ordering
- **Time** (constrained substrate; bookkeeps admissible ordering under finite resolution)
- **Space / geometry** (relational structure)
- **Boundary + admissibility** (constraints on persistence/change under finite resolution)
- **Continuity** (minimal persistence condition under which ordering remains composable across admissible evolution)
- **Energy** (cost label for admissible change)
- **Mass** (stable persistence mode; non-primitive label)
- **Gravity / curvature** (treated as an effective geometric response **associated with** stable persistence)
- **Measurement / record** (boundary-coupling event; finite resolution; irreversibility of record)

## Scope + refusals
This hierarchy exists to prevent category errors and over-claims.
We refuse causal or mechanistic language at CRL-0 (e.g., "X causes Y," "Y arises because X").
Use dependency-ordering language only: **treated as**, **associated with**, **depends on**, **scoped by**.
