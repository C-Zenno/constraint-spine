# INV_CONTINUITY_EXTENSION — Continuity as Admissible Extension

## Statement

Continuity is the condition under which admissible ordering remains composable across admissible evolution. Without continuity, composition of admissible steps is not guaranteed to remain admissible.

## Exclusions

Non-operative. Non-procedural. No test for continuity presence or absence. No threshold for sufficiency. No recovery procedure.
