# CG-FN-0 — Admissible Time, Claimability, and Identity Under Bounded Evolution
**Foundation Note (Stage-0 / observer-only / non-authoritative)**
**Status:** v0.2-final
**Series:** Constraint Geometry (CG) — Foundation Notes

---

## Scope Notice

This Foundation Note defines vocabulary and interpretation boundaries for admissible time, claimability, geometry closure, and identity/snapshot claims across domains.

It introduces **no procedures**, **no thresholds**, **no tuning guidance**, and **no deployment claims**. It is not a measurement protocol and does not authorize operational or evaluative systems.

This note is compatible with Stage-0 posture: **observer-only, refusal-first, non-authoritative, non-predictive**.

---

## Purpose

1. Define the minimal defensible claim an observer can make (Stage-0).
2. Define information as a claim class (receiptable distinction), not a substance.
3. Define admissible time as a coordinate setting that supports receiptable claims without importing mechanisms.
4. Define geometry closure as a way to certify the shape of admissibility/refusal, not the presence of structure.
5. Lock identity as a continuation claim, and prohibit upgrading snapshot similarity into persistence.

---

## 0.5 Non-Claims and Refusals (Stage-0)

This note does not introduce procedures, thresholds, mechanisms, or authority claims.

It does not assert ontological identities (e.g., "time = information," "mass = information"), nor does it license prediction, detection, verification, optimization, or semantic inference.

Geometry closure authorizes refusal statements only, never claims of correctness or absence.

Snapshot resemblance is explicitly insufficient for identity or continuation claims.

## Core Definitions (Locked)

### Observer
An observer is any entity or system that issues claims about structure under declared constraints. In Stage-0, observer claims are non-authoritative and must remain refusible.

### View family and bounded perturbation
A view family is a declared class of representations of a stream (projection, windowing, indexing, resampling class, or equivalent).
A bounded perturbation is any change to view parameters that remains inside explicitly declared bounds.

This note does not prescribe which perturbations to use. It defines how perturbations constrain what can be claimed.

### Repeatable structure
Repeatable structure denotes a structural distinction that persists across declared view families and bounded perturbations within those families. Repeatability is a claim condition, not a detection method.

### Claimability
A distinction is claimable (Stage-0) only if it can be stated as repeatable structure under bounded view perturbation, with sufficient provenance to be receiptable.

### Information (Stage-0 definition)
In this framework, "information" denotes the smallest receiptable distinction an observer can defend: a repeatable structural difference that persists under bounded view perturbation and can be attributed to declared view families and bounds.

Information is not treated as substance and is not equated with mass or energy.

### Admissible time
Admissible time is a coordinate choice in which repeatable structure can be stated and compared without importing mechanisms or thresholds. It is not a claim that "time is information." It is a claim that time-like coordinates often support receiptable repeatability statements.

---

## Minimal Claim Principle (Locked)

The minimal claim an observer can defend is:

> **Repeatable structure under bounded view perturbation.**

Any claim that depends on undeclared perturbations, hidden thresholds, implied procedures, or authority upgrades is non-admissible under Stage-0 posture and should be refused or demoted to metaphor.

---

## Time / Claimability Sections

### Constraint–Claimability ("Gates") (Stage-0)

Constraints do not create structure; they define the conditions under which a distinction can be stated defensibly. Time-like coordinates can *admit* order by *affording* stable indexing and window semantics ("gates") in which persistence becomes receiptable.

When a distinction remains repeatable across bounded perturbations, it becomes receiptable and therefore qualifies as "information" (Stage-0) — a claim class rather than a substance.

Over continuation, repeatability may degrade as perturbations accumulate or as the stream leaves declared bounds; this may be described as entropy pressure only as an interpretive metaphor for loss of claim stability. Stable early structure can act as footings (interpretive), supporting the formation of larger-scale repeatable distinctions ("higher-order structure" if receiptable) without implying prediction, optimization, or ontological identity.

---

## Identity & Closure Sections

### Emergence May Appear Stochastic (View-relative)

Early structure may present as stochastic when coherence is below the current view family's claimability floor. A distinction becomes claimable only when it persists across declared bounded variations in at least one view family.

Failure to persist licenses refusal, not denial: structure may be absent or may be present but not stably expressible in the current coordinate family.

### Claimability Ladder (Stochastic → Stable) (Stage-0)

"Stochastic" and "stable" are claimability classes relative to a declared view family and bounded perturbations—not ontological statements about the substrate.

1. **Stochastic / Unclaimable**
   No distinction remains repeatable under the declared bounded perturbations. The correct output is refusal.

2. **Proto-stable / Weakly claimable**
   A distinction persists only within a narrow subset of declared bounds. Sensitivity to perturbation remains high.

3. **Stable / Claimable**
   A distinction persists across declared bounded perturbations and can be made receiptable with declared provenance.

### Identity and Snapshot Claims (Definition + Refusal)

#### Identity / Persistence (Continuation claim)
An identity claim is a continuation claim: it asserts that a declared distinction remains repeatable across an observation window under admissible evolution (within declared bounds and perturbations), rather than being matched at a single index.

#### Snapshot / Pointwise resemblance
A snapshot claim is an instant claim. It may resemble the system at a single index but does not, by itself, carry continuation.

#### Interpretive Constraint (Locked)
Pointwise resemblance is not sufficient to establish identity. Identity is treated as persistence across windows under declared bounds, not proximity at an instant.

#### Refusal (Non-negotiable)
The program refuses any interpretation that upgrades snapshot similarity into identity, continuity, or persistence. When continuation cannot be carried, snapshot fidelity is treated as undefined for identity purposes.

> Identity is not a state; it is persistence under admissible evolution.

## Receipts / Traceability

Stage-0 claims must be receiptable: attributable to declared view families, declared bounds, window semantics, and provenance references.

Receipts ensure claims remain auditable, refusible, and non-authoritative.

This note does not mandate a specific receipt schema; it mandates that claims invoking admissible time, claimability, identity, or closure must be receiptable in principle.

---

## Exclusions (Full)

This note does not assert:
- time = information
- mass = information
- bits have mass
- recursion as ontology
- semantic authority
- verification procedures
- predictive or optimization claims

Such statements, when encountered, are treated as interpretive metaphors unless bounded and made receiptable, and even then remain non-authoritative.

---

## Governance Guardrails (Full)

- No procedures
- No thresholds
- No mechanism import
- No authority language
- No ontological identity claims
- No authority by closure
- No snapshot-to-identity upgrade

This note defines admissibility and refusal boundaries only.
