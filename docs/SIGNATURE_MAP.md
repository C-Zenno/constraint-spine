# Signature Map (Non-technical)

Constraint Physics uses one recurring map for legibility:

**Claim → Receipt → Refusal → Continuation**

- **Claim** is constrained speech.
- **Receipt** anchors the claim to bounded observability.
- **Refusal** protects the boundary when pressure arrives.
- **Continuation** remains conditional, never automatic.

This map is descriptive. It is not a procedure.
