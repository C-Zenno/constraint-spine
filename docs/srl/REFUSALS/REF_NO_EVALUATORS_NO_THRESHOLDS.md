# REF_NO_EVALUATORS — No Evaluators, No Thresholds

## Prohibition statement

This program refuses to publish evaluators (pass/fail systems, scoring functions, classification engines) or thresholds (numeric trigger boundaries, cutoff values, decision points) on any CRL-0 surface.

## Applies to

- All CRL-0 surfaces
- All derivative projections including SRL
- Glossary definitions: thresholds are explicitly listed as prohibited (Glossary term #16)

## Non-claims

- This refusal does not claim that evaluation is impossible.
- This refusal does not claim that thresholds have no role in any context.
- This refusal states only that evaluators and thresholds are outside the scope of CRL-0 and observer-only posture.
