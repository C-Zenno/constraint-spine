# INV_NON_EQUIVALENCE — Identity, Memory, Record, and Continuity Are Not Equivalent

## Statement

Identity, memory, record, and continuity are structurally distinct concepts. No one of them reduces to, implies, or substitutes for another.

## Exclusions

Non-operative. Non-procedural. No detection logic, no test for category errors, no metric for equivalence.
